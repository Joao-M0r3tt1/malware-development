- Privilege escalation via Acces Token Manipulation - Token inpersonation

    - Access Token Manipulation is a privilege escalation exploit, Which is kind of imiliar to Token Impersonation
    - We escalate our privileges by stealing a primary token of a privileged remote process running on the local system, Then, we duplicate that token and using it, We start a new process (a command prompt or a reverse shell binary) granting is full privileged Access
    - Although, to achieve this, the current user should have the SeDebugPrivilege. If it is disabled, we can enable it by using specific WinAPI functions


    - What exactly is an Access Token
        - An Access Token on Windows is an object which sprecifies security context of a process or a thread
        - When a user logs in to their system, The system generates an Access Token which contains specific information such as SID of the account, a logon SID, source of the access token etc.
        - every process which is executed on the behalf of the user has a copy of this access token
        - there are two types of Access Token
            - Primary token: a token created by the windows kernel, it is assigned to a process to represent the default security information for that process- Impersonation token: a token which captures the security information of a client process, allowing a server to "impersonate" the client process in security operations
